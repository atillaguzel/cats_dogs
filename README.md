### The Scope of the Project

This project is the assignment of "Machine Learning for Classification" module at BBS Data Science Program.
The general goal of this assignment is to show a practical application of the methods shown during the module. To accomplish this goal, performance of a multi-class SVM with that of a multi-class neural network is compared.

### Selected Problem

To unveil the performance of SVMs and ANNs, an image classification problem is framed.
Kaggle website contains numerous datasets and challenges that are appropriate for any image classification problem.
From the said website "Dogs and Cats" challenge was examined and chosen.

### Framework
CRISP-DM framework is used throughout this project's comparison process.

### Tools

For this assignment, in addition to Phyton 3.6 and its libraries sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, skimage, imagenet_utils, pickle a library specialized in deep learning called Keras+Tensorflow are used.
Compatibility issues were dealt with code alterations and consistency checks.
